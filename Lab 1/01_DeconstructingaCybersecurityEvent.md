# Deconstructing a Cybersecurity Event

> **Overview**: On May 8, 2023, Dragos, an industrial cybersecurity company, thwarted a cybercriminal group's attempt to extort them. The attackers exploited a business email compromise (BEC) to compromise the personal email account of a new, yet-to-begin employee. Dragos' security tools detected and blocked the attack, including phishing attempts on other employees. Their incident response team successfully prevented any further harm and shared this experience to destigmatize security incidents and aid other organizations in learning from it.
>
> **Objective**: Conduct a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) on the incident. Consider the following aspects:
>
>  - **Financial Impact**: What financial losses or costs did Dragos incur due to this incident?
>
>  - **Operational Impact**: How did the incident affect Dragos' day-to-day operations, including its ability to provide cybersecurity services?
>
>  - **Reputational Impact**: Discuss the impact on Dragos' reputation and relationships with clients and stakeholders.
>
>  - Research additional perspectives that are relevant to the incident
