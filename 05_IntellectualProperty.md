## Data Breach

Samsung Electronics recently got a data breach that revealed unauthorized information (names, phone numbers, postal codes and email addresses) to an unauthorized individual. This impacted the UK customers of Samsung around July 2019 to June 2020. There was a bug found in a third-party app that the company uses that allowed the attacker to execute their breach.

#### What are the impacts to the organization?

- This damages their reputation. They are known as one of the leading electronic companies in the world and are expected to be able to secure their own systems.
- They may close their connection with that third-party that was involved due to the irresponsible actions of not securing their systems.
- Financial loss occurs to try and mitigate and improve their services to fix and avoid such attacks from happening again.
- Compliance issues between Samsung and the third-party occur.

#### What are the legal consequences faced by the perpetrators?

- So far, the perpetrator was not yet caught. But if the unauthorized person is caught, they may face:
  - Legal fines and charges
  - Asset seizures
  - Imprisonment and lawsuits
  - Extradition and red flag notices

#### Lessons and Insights to enhance IR strategies.

- Samsung and the third-party can use encryption and encrypt their data and information so that when incidents like data breaches occur, they can keep the data secure despite being stolen.
- Utilize an effective incident response and create a post-incident response to have a log on the incident for future uses. May it be for other incidents or references to improve security.
- Integrate proper threat intelligence and immediate consult with legal authorities to handle the situation.

## Trade Secret Theft

Pegasystems Inc. had stolen Appian Corp.’s trade secrets and was given a $2.036 Billion dollar fine in damages. This is based on what Pegasystems have learned/gained from Appian. Pegasystems develops software for customer relationship management and business process management while Appian Corp. is a cloud computing and enterprise software company that sells a platform-as-a-service —a cloud environment that includes things that developers need for building, running, and managing applications— for building enterprise software applications.

#### What are the impacts to the organization?

***For Appian Corp.:***

- Appian shares had a stock market jump of 39% (at that time).
- Appian gains $2B or 50% in company value based on their $4B market cap.
- Loss of their competitive advantage due to stolen secrets. This may cause the company to hold back in technological advancements/developments. 
- There may be employee mistrust or doubts because of uncertainties.
- Loss on company integrity; business relationships may have doubts doing business with Appian.

***For Pegasystems Inc.:***

- Pegasystems shared had a stock market drop of 21% (at that time)
- Pegasystems also has a $4B market cap, therefore, losses 50%.
- Affects their reputation negatively because of legal charges.
- Could gain a business advantage with the trade secrets stolen.
- There may be employee mistrust or doubts because of uncertainties.
- Business relationships new, old or current will affect them negatively because of the company’s integrity.

#### What are the legal consequences faced by the perpetrators?

Pegasystems Inc. are required to pay a lump sum of more than $2 Billion to Appian Corp. for the total of things they have stolen based on their market cap.

#### Lessons and Insights to enhance IR strategies.

- Review agreements and update or change necessary portions to secure the proper access to business activities; Enhance the company’s NDA agreements to better the security, implementations and behavior of the employees.
- Adding a Non-Compete Agreements may help in deterring the company’s roles and involvements with access to important secrets of the company.
- Enhance monitoring personnel and technical activities to see if there are suspicious activities outside what should done in the company environment.

## Copyright Infringement Incident

### Modern Dog Design vs. Target

Modern Dog designed sketches of dogs from Chronicle Books. These designs were said to have been used by Disney and Target to produce shirts without their permission. Target and Disney intentionally stole the image through Amazon’s “look inside” of the Chronicle Book as well as removing the copyright notice from it. Copyright is immediately in place when it is on a fixed medium.

#### What are the impacts to the organization?

***For Modern Dog:***

- Initially, winning the case should be a good thing. However, in the case of Modern Dog, they lost a lot of money, employees and their studio to be able to afford to fight the case against Disney and Target because of Intellectual Property Infringements. It seemed that they did not gain much business-wise after getting justice.
- They gained the copyrights to the design but at the cost of a lot more including selling the company afterwards.

***For Disney and Target:***

- This caused them time and money. However, with companies as big as them, losing to the case did not affect them or cost them as much compared to what happened to Modern Dog.
- This affects their reputation for being open to creating fake or stealing designs from other companies or people for the sake of money. Yet, they lost customers due to the issue.

#### What are the legal consequences faced by the perpetrators?

- With everything that I can find, they violated the AIGA (the American Institute of Graphic Arts) Design Business and Ethics code.
- A lot of the information regarding this case have been redacted and taken down from websites. I only found overall thoughts and discussions regarding this.

#### Lessons and Insights to enhance IR strategies.

I think for this scenario (with the given information) they were already doing the right procedures to tackle the copyright. However, they were battling against a company that had a far bigger budget for cases like this. The best case that would have happened may have been for Modern Dog to dismiss or ignore the case against Disney and Target if it meant that they would not lose their money and business. In the end, their win against Disney and Target led to their bankruptcy and company closer.
